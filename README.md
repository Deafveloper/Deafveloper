# Destiny O'Connor · Deafveloper 🖐️💻

## Follow the rabbit 🐇

I’m a full-stack developer and educator focused on turning real-world experience into practical technology.

I teach Deaf and Hard of Hearing students with Deaf Kids Code, where I teach computer science, web development, and applied machine learning. I design lesson plans that start with what students already know and use those skills to teach technical concepts, helping learners build portfolios and see their experience as professional, technical work.

I contribute to CNCF initiatives and create documentation to support community programs, training, and inclusive technical spaces.

I continue building full-stack applications through Tri-C and independent projects, working with Python, Django, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL.

Build down the rabbit hole. we all mad here. 🐇
