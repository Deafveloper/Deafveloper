# 👋 Hi, I'm Destiny — the Deafveloper!

**Wondering about the wordplay?**  

**Deaf** + **Developer** = *Deafveloper* 💻✨

I’m a passionate Deaf web developer and accessibility advocate crafting roadmaps for a more inclusive tech world. Whether I’m building websites, sharing my journey, or teaching Deaf kids how to code in ASL, I’m all about making tech *make sense* — for everyone.


## 🌟 What I Do

- Contribute to the [CNCF Deaf & Hard of Hearing Working Group](https://www.cncf.io)  
- Web Developer at [Women Blessing Women](https://womenblessingwomen.org)  
- Facilitator for [Deaf Kids Code](https://deafkidscode.org) (visual, hands-on coding in ASL)  
- Advocate for inclusive tech, accessible learning, and creative expression


## 🔧 What I'm Working On (2025)

- 🪄 **Tom Riddle Journal** — an interactive coding project where the diary replies to you (yes, really)  
- 🎓 **Courses for Deaf Kids** — hands-on, visual-first AI & coding lessons using Canva, p5.js & Elementari  
- 🧠 **Learning All I Can About AI** — diving deep into ethical AI, education tools, and creative use cases


## 🐾 Fun Facts About Me

Let’s just say... nature loves me. Or loves chasing me.  

- 🦅 Got chased by a bald eagle while canoeing the **Meramec River in MO** — crashed into a tree, and *spiders* rained into the boat.  
- 🐶 Got chased by a Dalmatian named **Sprinkles** (my sister’s dog) at age 9 in **Inglewood, CA**.  
- 🐀 A **possum** ran me down in **Hawthorne, CA**.  
- 🦝 A **raccoon** came for me in **Santa Barbara, CA**.  
- 🌺 Got *kissed* by a **hummingbird** in **Redondo Beach, CA**.  
- 🐕 And once, while chasing my niece's dog Chester to bring him back inside, I looked back and saw both of us being chased by a **German Shepherd in Los Angeles, CA**!

Basically, I’ve lived a full National Geographic episode.
