## ● Follow the rabbit 🐇

I’m a full-stack developer focused on building practical, real-world applications shaped by lived experience, teaching, and continuous learning.

I teach Deaf and Hard of Hearing students with Deaf Kids Code, leading instruction in computer science, web development, and applied technology. My teaching centers on helping students turn what they already know from their work and daily life into technical skill and professional experience.

I teach introductory machine learning using tools such as Google Teachable Machine and TensorFlow through real-world examples. For example, students have trained models to recognize different hairstyles based on hairdressing experience and built web portfolios that document both their technical and industry skills. Others have trained models to recognize different types of food they prepare, connecting machine learning to culinary experience and digital portfolios.

I also work with students with custodial and facilities experience to train models that recognize different surfaces, materials, or environmental conditions relevant to their work. These projects focus on process awareness, safety, and efficiency, and help students document how technical systems can be built directly from hands-on job knowledge.

Alongside teaching, I contribute to community-driven tech initiatives connected to CNCF and continue building full-stack applications through Tri-C and independent projects, working with Python, Django, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL to build end-to-end systems.

I value clarity, usability, and building things that actually get used.  
Follow the rabbit. Build down the rabbit hole. 🐇
