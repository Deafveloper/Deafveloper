### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio website.
- 🌱 I’m taking Harvard edx CS50 Course
- 🤟 I’m looking to collaborate with fellow Deaf developers.
- 👩🏽‍💻 I'm currently encouraging all my friends to join the tech world!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am at the toddler stage of programming. I’m not a newbie but I am at the terrible 3s I mess up a lot. I am SteveUrkle in the tech world. “Did I do that?!"
