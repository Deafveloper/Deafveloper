Hello! I’m a Deaf web developer and educator. I teach kids how to code with Deaf Kids Code as a facilitator, and I contribute to open source through the CNCF Deaf and Hard of Hearing Working Group. We create accessibility guides for conferences and workplaces to help make tech more inclusive. I'm a passionate advocate for accessibility, a gamer, coder, and storyteller — and a traveling mom of many. It can get chaotic, but looking back, those adventures are some of our best memories.
