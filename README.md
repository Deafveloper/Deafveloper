# About Me ✨

Greetings, fellow wanderers of the digital realm! 🌌 I am Silent CodeCaster, a web-weaving enchantress on a quest to craft captivating digital realms while championing accessibility and inclusion.

🏞️ **Enchanted Roots:**
Nestled in the heart of Los Angeles, California, my journey led me to the enchanting forest city of Cleveland, Ohio...

🧙 **Magical Abilities:**
I am a deaf self-taught full-stack web developer, having embarked on my coding journey in 2019. Through the weaving of intricate spells in the form of code, I have helped over 16 small businesses navigate the enchanted realms of technology. I assist them in choosing the right magical tools and conjure graphic designs to bring their digital dwellings to life. But here's my secret power — I can speak through my hands, letting the magic of code tell stories untold.

🌌 **Web Magic & Advocacy:**
In my digital alchemy, I have earned the moniker Silent CodeCaster. As a magical advocate for the deaf and hard of hearing, I cast spells to break barriers and amplify awareness. Every line of code is a thread in the tapestry of accessibility, weaving a path to inclusivity and understanding.

🔮 **Experience & Expertise:**
An accomplished web specialist with a penchant for innovation, I have thrived in collaborative team environments, supporting small businesses with four years of expertise in database administration and the development of responsive websites. My journey involves not just crafting code but creating enchanting experiences that leave a lasting magical impression.

Join me on this magical journey as we continue to create spellbinding digital realms, where every incantation of code echoes with the melody of inclusion and accessibility.

May your pixels be ever vibrant and your code forever enchanted! ✨
