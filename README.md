### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio website.
- 🌱 I’m learning JavaScript.
- 🤟 I’m looking to collaborate with fellow Deaf developers.
- -👩🏽‍💻 I'm currently encouraging all my friends to join the tech world!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am at the toddler stage of programming. I’m not a newbie but I am at the terrible 3s I f🥸🥸k up a lot. I knocked the street lights out on a company's website I was hired for 😱. I saved myself by tracking down the original developer that built the website. I still don’t know what I did to cause the blackout 😳. I am on my way to f😵😵k up some more projects. I am SteveUrkle in the tech world. “Did I do that?!
